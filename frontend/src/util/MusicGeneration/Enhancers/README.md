Much like the Algorithms folder there was an idea to do something similar with a separate enhancers folders that work on any generation algorithm there was.
This was abandoned, but the basic structure is still there to implement it if you would like. It's organized exactly like the algorithms and there are a couple
artifacts in the code refering to this.
